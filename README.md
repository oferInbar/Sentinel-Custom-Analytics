# Sentinel Custom Analytics
A Sentinel customizable behavioral analytics solution using KQL and Playbooks

Sentinel has robust analytics capabilities, but many do not address custom logs, such as business application logs and non-standard IT logs, and don't allow customers to tweak the analysis. 

In this project, we will develop a Sentinel solution that uses KQL, watchlists, and playbooks (with Azure Functions as an option) to allow customers to define behavioral analytics on any data source, any variable, and a choice of behavioral algorithms. We will also aim to add a few out-of-the-box behavioral analytics rules to demonstrate the use of the new solution.
